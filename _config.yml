  My name is Pablo Alvarez de Sotomayor Posadillo, and Iâ€™m a Free
  Software activist from Cordoba (Spain). I'm currently living in Mexico
  City, and I'm currently working on Segundamano Mexico, which it's part
  of Schibsted Classifieds Media.

  In this blog I'll write both technical posts and personal opinions,
  but I'll try to focus on the technical posts as much as possible. This
  is my personal blog, so every opinion I write here is my own personal
  opinion. If you want to know a little more about me you can visit
