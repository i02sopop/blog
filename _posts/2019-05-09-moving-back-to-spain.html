Hi all,
</p>

<p>
After more than three and a half years in Mexico working at Segundamano Mexico
I've decided to accept an offer from <a href="https://www.zaleos.net/">Zaleos</a> and come back to Spain. As you may
know, I've been working at Schibsted (the company that owns Segundamano) for
eight years, first in Madrid for a period of four years and a half aproximately
and later in Mexico City for the last three and a half years, and it have been
an amazing time, both personally (I've meet some great people, some of them
will remain friends in the future) and personally (I can't even list all the
things I've learned during this time), but at certain point I felt that I needed
a new challenge to keep growing professionally, and at the same time I wanted
to be closer to my family, since we were more than 10000 kms away, and that is
where Zaleos comes.
</p>

Zaleos is a software development company that designs and develops ip based solutions
to provide to the Public Safety sector with the much-needed ability to interface with
multiple sources of data and receive critical, real-time information from callers in
need, so I'll be seeing technologies related with VoIP and real time protocols, a
full new field for me in the working environment, so don't be surprise if I start
posting entries about real time protocols :).
</p>

<p>
Happy Hacking!
