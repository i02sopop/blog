I have to admit that I've been quite lazy the last three years in
terms of blogging, but I have some time lately and I've moved my old
blog to octopress 3.
</p>

<p>
In general looks like it's easier to work with once is set up
properly, but there's not so much documentation as with octopress 2
and build it up is a little bit more try and error.
</p>

<p>
The basic directory structure is very similar to any other jekyll
based blog (with directories for include, templates, posts, &#x2026;), but,
as the oposite you could find in Octopress 2, you don't have a
Rakefile to build the blog neither a source dir with the sass theme
and the blog structure. So, if you want to see your changes locally
you have to run jekyll serve.
</p>

<p>
One of the things that I think they have enhace in Octopress 3 is the
publishing management, because, instead of using Rake as with
Octopress 2, they provide a ruby command to manage all that, providing
octopress new {post|page|draft} to generate a new post, page or
draft and octopress {publish|unpublish} to publish a draft or
unpublish a post, so the management of posts is now more easier from
my point of view. Finally, with octopress deploy you can deploy your
changes to the final destination (github, another git repo, rsync, S3,
&#x2026;).
</p>

<p>
You can have more information about Octopress 3 and Jekyll in the
<a href="https://github.com/octopress/octopress">Octopress 3 github page</a> and in the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll project page</a>. So, now that I
have my blog again working and linked with org-octopress I hope I can
write more often.
</p>

<p>
Happy Hacking.
