Hi all!</p>

<p>
I had prepared the next entry of the Android testing tutorial, but I've found a
<a href="http://www.vogella.com/articles/AndroidTesting/article.html">tutorial</a> that explains everything about it, even some of the projects that improve
the Android test environment, so I've decided not reinvent the wheel and stop this
tutorial. It's true that some parts seems more a summary than a tutorial, but there's
nothing essential missing.</p>

<p>
I know you will miss my explanations, but, as usual, I don't have much time and I
prefer to blog about new things, so sorry about keeping you in the half of the process</p>
<p>
:(.</p>

<p>
Happy Hacking!</p>
